# NSSPlots

This code makes use of the output files from the NSSS code that computes a series of constant 
baryonic mass tracks of neutron stars with changing spin velocity.

The python (version 2.7) code Plots.py generates various plots combining the data from the ten files. 
To run it from the Terminal the following command line is used "python Plots.py" and by typing a number from 1 to 18 
and "enter" we get the chosen plot.

The code "Plot_oneEOS.py" can be run in the same way, but this only generates the plot using one equation of state, 
instead of the 10 in the code "Plots.py"
